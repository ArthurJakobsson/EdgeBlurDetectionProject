#EdgeBlurDetectionProject


This project enables a user to detect the blur of an image and the outlines in a video. It is able to detect live input of data through the computer's video camera and detect information about this. There are several subprojects included in this project. One of them is a project that analzyes using blur detection for how blurry an image is. The next part of the project searches for edges in an image: one file in this section of the project will crop out that individual portion of the image. Another portion of the project looks and analyzes a live video stream for objects and egdes and creates cropped images of these sections.

This project is written in Python and can be run directly from the terminal. I wrote this project on a Mac and I have not tested it yet on a Windows computer, but I believe it should function properly and if it does not, the changes that need to be made are in the commands that control the web-camera.
